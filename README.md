# Pyber_Analysis

Overview of the analysis

We reviewed three different city types (Urban, Suburban, and Rural) for Pyber drivers.  We looked at the number of rides, number of drivers,
and their fare prices.  Once we had that we broke it down a bit more by reviewing a 4 month period in 2019 (January thur April) for all 
the three city types to review their total fares. During the initial analysis we can see that the rural drivers did make more in
their fares on average but they also didn't have as many drivers there.  OUr urban drivers though overall created the mos fares
for Pyber.
